# Pomodoro!
## The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

* Decide on the task to be done.
* Set the pomodoro timer.
* Work on the task.
* End work when the timer rings (pomodoro ends), or manually end the task and take a 5 minute break.
* After four pomodoros, take a 15 minute break. After the 15 minute break, go to step 1.
