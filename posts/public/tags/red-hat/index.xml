      <description>Systemd is considered to be the future standard init system by all mainstream Linux distributions. The Systemd System and Service Manager uses &amp;ldquo;units&amp;rdquo; as an abstraction for parts of the system to be managed: typically services, sockets, mounts and targets. It provides a uniform interface for managing units.
The systemctl -t help command displays a list of available units that can be managed with Systemd.
[student@server1 ~]$ systemctl -t help Available unit types: service mount swap socket target device automount timer path slice scope Each unit type can be recognized by the file extension.</description>

      <description>Access Control Lists allow you to add permissions to more than one user or group on the same file or directory, and allows you to set default permissions for newly created files and directories.
Managing ACLs It&amp;rsquo;s possible you need need to add file system support for ACLs during boot time by adding the acl mount option the the /etc/fstab file. That would be the case when you&amp;rsquo;re seeing the Operation not supported message when applying an ACL.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m dual booting between RHEL 8 and Windows 10 and the NTFS drive I use to share data between my two operating systems was suddenly mounted Read Only on Linux.
While trying to mount the drive again, I was facing the following message:
[root@rhel8 mnt]# umount -l /dev/sda1 [root@rhel8 mnt]# mount -t ntfs-3g -o rw /dev/sda1 /mnt/data The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0). Metadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I decided to go ahead and install RHEL8 on my laptop and use it as my everyday workstation as well as a learning platform to move forward on my Red Hat certification path.
In case you&amp;rsquo;re interested, you can actually use RHEL for free with a No-Cost RHEL Developer Subscription as long as you don&amp;rsquo;t use the machine &amp;ldquo;in production&amp;rdquo;.
After a pretty straightforward installation of RHEL 8 I was immediately confronted with a first issue.</description>
