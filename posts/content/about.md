My name is Joeri (pronounced as Yuri), I work as a SysOps Engineer for a managed WordPress hosting provider. On a typical day, I investigate bugs and issues affecting our platform, monitor our infrastructure and respond to outages, take steps to stabilize the infrastructure, and assist in the development of new and existing tools.

Formerly I provided technical support on business-critical infrastructure in industry sectors where ITIL principles are followed.

I’m mainly interested in open source technologies, I automate boring stuff using Python and Ruby and occasionally game on my Fedora Linux machine. I'm always committed to continuous professional development:
